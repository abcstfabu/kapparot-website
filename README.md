# Kapparot Online - Digital Tzedakah Website

A respectful and modern web application that allows Jewish individuals to perform the Kapparot ritual through charitable giving, following the contemporary practice of using money instead of chickens.

## About Kapparot

Kapparot is a Jewish ritual performed before Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) where individuals symbolically transfer their sins through charitable giving.
